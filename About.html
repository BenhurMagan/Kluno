                        <p>The purpose of Kluno is to take part in recycling of used clothing. Only 15% of used clothing are being recycled annually.
                            Therefore by redesigning donated clothing, whether it be in bad or perfect condition, less waste is made. Lawrence also would like
                            to promote his designs and business skills through this website.

                        <h2>Saving</h2>
                        <p>
                            Saving is a byproduct of Kluno. Compared to buying clothes on other stores, Kluno will have products that are affordable despite its
                            professional designs.
